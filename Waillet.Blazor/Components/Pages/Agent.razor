<h1>Agent.md</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Agent.md</strong> files are designed to guide AI agents like GitHub Copilot in making focused code changes while adhering to project-specific rules and constraints. By defining the purpose, scope, rules, and workflow in an Agent.md file, developers can ensure that AI-generated code aligns with their project's standards and requirements.
</p>

<h2>Basic structure</h2>

<pre><code># Agent.md

## Purpose
Describe what this agent should do.

## Scope
- What it can change
- What it must not change

## Rules
- Keep changes minimal
- Follow existing coding style
- Run build/tests after edits

## Workflow
1. Read relevant files
2. Propose or apply focused changes
3. Validate with build/tests
4. Summarize results and next steps

## Output format
- Short summary
- Changed files
- Validation status
</code></pre>

<h2>How to use with Copilot</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Create or update your <strong>Agent.md</strong> in the repository.</li>
    <li>Describe the task in chat (for example: "Implement X using rules from Agent.md").</li>
    <li>Ask Copilot to follow the file constraints while making changes.</li>
    <li>Review changed files and run/build results before committing.</li>
</ol>
